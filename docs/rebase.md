To ensure that your second feature branch is up to date with the changes from the develop branch, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Checkout the Develop Branch:**
   First, make sure you are currently on your feature2 branch. You can switch to it using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout feature2
   ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes:**
   Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository's develop branch. This will ensure you have the most recent updates without merging them just yet.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin develop
   ```

3. **Rebase onto Develop:**
   After fetching the latest changes from the develop branch, you can rebase your feature2 branch onto the updated develop branch. This will apply the changes from develop on top of your feature2 branch.

   ```bash
   git rebase origin/develop
   ```

   This command will rebase your feature2 branch on top of the updated develop branch.

4. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are any conflicts during the rebase, Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve them. You will need to manually edit the conflicted files, then use `git add` to mark the conflicts as resolved.

5. **Continue Rebase:**
   After resolving any conflicts, continue the rebase process by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

6. **Push Changes:**
   Once the rebase is complete, push the changes to your feature2 branch on the remote repository to ensure that your branch is up to date.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature2
   ```

Your feature2 branch should now be up to date with the latest changes from the develop branch. This approach allows you to integrate the changes from the develop branch while keeping a linear history in your feature branch.
